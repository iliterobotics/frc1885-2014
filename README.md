frc1885-2014
============

This repository is dedicated to the robot code (code that runs on the cRIO) for FRC Team 1885 for the 2014 season, Aerial Assist.

The code under the "Robot" directory is the code that will be loaded onto 2014's robot.
This code is based on the framework extracted from 2012's code.

The code under the "beta_framework" directory is a new framework under development.
It eliminates any global data structures and encapsulates each manipulator/subsystem and all of its input sensors and output actuators.
This framework is still imcomplete and will not be implemented during the 2014 season. Development will resume off season.
